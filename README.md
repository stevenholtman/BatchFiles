# BatchFiles Readme
Welcome to my <a href="https://github.com/stevenholtman">@stevenholtman</a> repository for CMD Batch Files for Network Administration

I have compiled several of my scripts that I have developed over the years as an IT Administrator to make available conviently for other IT Administrtaors for use by other IT Administrators or people who are interested in learning more about scripts.

I configured the scripts to use computer names for domain enviorments, so if you are in a workgroup and want to test them against your local computer just use localhost for the comptuername.
