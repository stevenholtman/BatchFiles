CMD Batch Scripts for Network Administration

I have compiled some of my scripts I created over the years as an IT Administrator to make available conviently for other IT Administrtaors for use by other IT Administrators or people who are interested in learning more about scripts.

I configured the scripts to use computer names for domain enviorments, so if you are in a workgroup and want to test them against your local computer just use localhost for the comptuername.
